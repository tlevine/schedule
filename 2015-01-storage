I can switch from my present $71 storage unit to a $29 storage unit next to
the Chicago Amtrak. This is pretty easy; pack everything up in two or three
bags, and move it.

Even better, I can switch to storing one or two boxes with Ship2Storage.
https://www.ship2storage.com. This will cost the same (for two boxes, or half
the price for one box) but will even be more convenient than that especially
convenient storage unit. How would I go about this?

One of the two "boxes" would be my pink suitcase. For the other, I could buy
a fancy one from Grainger.

Here's what I do with the stuff in the unit.

Clothes

* Leave the clothes that are falling apart at home.
* Take three pairs of nice clothes with me.
* Mail the remaining nice clothes that fit me to
* Donate any leftover clothes to a thrift shop.

Pack on the bike

* Any sort of sleeping equipment
* Desktop computer

Other things that get stored

* Paper notebooks
* EMG/audio equipment
* Books

Try to give away

* Bubble hat
* Meditation cushion

Possible Sudoroom toys

* Tiny pink laptop (I need to remove the data first.)
* Wooden toy parts
* Chess set
* Electric steamer
