If I get a 14-day rail pass, what could I do? I can do up to eight segments.

Here's the simplest thing.

December 30, Seattle
January 1, Chicago (Empire Builder)
January 2, New York (Lake Shore Limited)
January 9, Chicago (Lake Shore Limited)
January 11, Oakland (California Zeyphr)

I could take a detour to the Sunset Limited route.

December 30, Seattle
January 1, Chicago (Empire Builder)
January 2, New York (Lake Shore Limited)
January 8, New Orleans (Crescent)
January 11, Los Angeles (Sunset Limited)
January 12, Oakland (Coast Starlight)

And I can, of course, break any of these segments into two and sight-see for a day.
