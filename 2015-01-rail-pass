If I get a 14-day rail pass, what could I do? I can do up to eight segments.

Here's the simplest thing.

December 30, Seattle
January 1, Chicago (Empire Builder)
January 2, New York (Lake Shore Limited)
January 9, Chicago (Lake Shore Limited)
January 11, Emeryville (California Zeyphr)

I could go back through Portland, to see the other leg of the Empire Builder.

December 30, Seattle
January 1, Chicago (Empire Builder)
January 2, New York (Lake Shore Limited)
January 9, Chicago (Lake Shore Limited)
January 11, Portland (Empire Builder)
January 12, Oakland (Coast Starlight)

If I went back through Seattle, I could leave my bike here.

December 30, Seattle
January 1, Chicago (Empire Builder)
January 2, New York (Lake Shore Limited)
January 9, Chicago (Lake Shore Limited)
January 11, Seattle (Empire Builder)
January 12, Oakland (Coast Starlight)

I could take a detour to the Sunset Limited

December 30, Seattle
January 1, Chicago (Empire Builder)
January 2, New York (Lake Shore Limited)
January 8, New Orleans (Crescent)
January 11, Los Angeles (Sunset Limited)
January 12, Oakland (Coast Starlight)

or to the Vermonter.

December 30, Seattle
January 1, Chicago (Empire Builder)
January 2, New York (Lake Shore Limited)
January 7, St. Albans (Vermonter)
January 8, Springfield (Vermonter)
January 9, Chicago (Lake Shore Limited)
January 11, Emeryville (California Zeyphr)

Here's another idea.

December 30, Seattle
January 1, Chicago (Empire Builder)
January 2, New York (Lake Shore Limited)
January 7, St. Albans (Vermonter)
January 8, Springfield (Vermonter)
January 9, Chicago (Lake Shore Limited)
January 12, Seattle (Empire Builder)
January 13, Oakland (Coast Starlight), with bike

I can, of course, combine the interesting parts of the above itineraries
and break any of the segments into two and sight-see for a day.

I could also get a longer rail pass and use the remaining segments for
travel after Cyber Wizard Institute and during the weekends. Consider these
itineraries for a 30-day pass.

Here's another idea.

December 30, Seattle
January 1, Chicago (Empire Builder)
January 2, New York (Lake Shore Limited)
January 9, Chicago (Lake Shore Limited)
January 12, Seattle (Empire Builder)
January 13, Oakland (Coast Starlight), with bike
January 16, Somewhere for the weekend
January 19, Oakland
January 23, Somewhere for the weekend
January 26, Oakland
January 29, Somewhere to go next

In case I need to work during the week,

Wednesday, December 31, leave Seattle (present contract ends)
Friday, January 2, transit through Chicago
Saturday, January 3, arrive in New York
Friday, January 9, leave New York
Saturday, January 10, transit through Chicago
Monday, January 12, arrive in Seattle (to get my bike)
Tuesday, January 13, leave Seattle
Wednesday, January 14, arrive in Oakland

If I need to be available January 1, I can
add a stop somewhere and leave a day earlier
or arrive a day later. If I need to be available
January 13, I can split that trip into two and
leave a day earlier or arrive a day later.

The Amtrak person set up this itinerary. My confirmation number is 389BD9.

Current thinking:

Wednesday, December 31, leave Seattle (present contract ends)
Friday, January 2, transit through Chicago, set up the storage unit, and drop off my bike
Saturday, January 3, arrive in New York
Thursday, January 8, leave New York
Friday, January 9, transit through Chicago (arrive at 9:45 am, leave at 3:00 pm, check the bike by 1:00 pm to be safe)
Sunday, January 11, arrive in Emeryville

This leaves THREE EXTRA DAYS!!!

A similar possibility is to spend a day in Chicago (so I have time to
deal with the storage unit, take Southwest Chief to Los Angeles, and
spend a day there, and then take Coast Starlight up further. Or maybe
I take the Pacific Surfliner for a bit of the way so I can stay in a
different city for a night.



Day trips
================
Here's a fun idea: Take day trips where I sleep on the train.
Do this from Chicago or New York so I don't need to worry about my bike.

Chicago would fit in like so.

December 31, leave Seattle
January 2, transit through Chicago and set up the storage unit (segment 1)
January 3, arrive in New York (segment 2)
January 7, leave New York
January 8, transit through Chicago, and drop off the bags (segment 3)
January 9, first day trip (segment 4)
January 10, second day trip (segment 5)
January 11, third day trip (segment 6)
January 12, transit through Chicago, boarding the California Zeyphr with my bike (segment 7)
January 14, arrive in Emeryville, with my bike (segment 8)

I have four segments to use in these day trips, and I have as many as
five days to spend on these trips.

Let's consider, first, the City of New Orleans corridor.
http://www.amtrak.com/ccurl/744/819/City-of-New-Orleans-Schedule-060914.pdf

It leaves Chicago 0 at 8 pm, which gives me lots of time to mess with my
storage unit after arriving at 9:45 am from New York. And then I get off
in the morning at any of these cities. (I'd have more time in the earlier
cities.)

* Memphis, TN (13 hours)
* Greenwood, MS (10 hours)
* Yazoo City, MS (8 hours)
* Jackson, MS (6 hours)

If I want to spend all of my day trips on this one corridor I could take
another day trip in any of the proceeding cities and then get on the train
in the other direction the next day, to another of the preceding cities.

* Chicago, IL
* Homewood, IL
* Kankakee, IL

I could also stay at a hotel or hostel or something for a night, though
I'd rather do it at one of these cities so I have longer.

"One does not ride the City of New Orleans for the scenery."

But there are other options. Consider the Southwest Chief, for example,
if I care about that.
http://www.amtrak.com/ccurl/710/620/Southwest-Chief-Schedule-110214.pdf

These would all be reasonable.

* Garden City, KS
* Lamar, CO
* La Junta, CO
* Trinidad, CO

And I could also ride all the way to Los Angeles and back!

The California Zephyr?
http://www.amtrak.com/ccurl/692/258/Amtrak-California-Zephyr-Train-Route-Guide-2014.pdf

These are the options,

* Fort Morgan, CO
* Denver, CO
* Fraser-Winter Park, CO

but it arrives back in Chicago after it leaves again for Emeryville, so
I would have to stay somewhere for a night.

I could also stop there with my bike on the way to Emeryville. That gives
many options!

The Empire Builder
http://www.amtrak.com/ccurl/754/288/Empire-Builder-Schedule-100114.pdf

seems like a bad idea because of the present high chance of delays.
http://www.amtrak.com/ccurl/455/506/Empire%20Builder%20Detour%20PSN%201014-03.pdf


New York trips?

I could do a day trip to Portland, to see the pink hat hackers finally.
http://www.amtrak.com/downeaster-train

That would use four segments!

Silver Star could be interesting. Maybe.
http://www.amtrak.com/ccurl/19/50/Silver-Service-Palmetto-Schedule-060914.pdf



I looked up a bunch of these cities. Many of them are quite small and have
hardly any internet presence. The following stood out as worth visiting on
without a bike/car.

* Memphis, TN
* Yazoo, MS
* Jackson, MS
* Garden City, KS
* La Junta, CO
* Trinidad, CO

And then I looked further.

Garden City has some parks for humans and other parks for bison.
http://kdwpt.state.ks.us/news/KDWPT-Info/Locations/Wildlife-Areas/Region-3/Sandsage-Bison-Range

Yazoo has some civil war museums, one of which is right next to the Amtrak station.
http://visityazoo.org/what-to-do/museums/

I have heard of Memphis and Jackson, so they surely have stuff,
but I'm also not interested, because I have heard of them.

Trinidad has some interesting stuff listed on Wikivoyage.
http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Trinidad_%28Colorado%29

and a free trolley tour!
http://historictrinidad.com/

La Junta REALLY likes visitors. What's up with that?
http://www.visitlajunta.org/

So now I have narrowed it down to

* Yazoo
* Trinidad
* La Junta

Trinidad and La Junta look great, but I can't go there and back
because the timing of trains isn't as good.

So this is the itinerary that I'm looking at now.

December 31, leave Seattle
January 2, transit through Chicago and set up the storage unit (segment 1)
January 3, arrive in New York (segment 2)
January 8, leave New York
January 9, transit through Chicago, and drop off the bags (segment 3)
January 10, day trip to Yazoo City (segment 4)
January 11, transit through Chicago, pick up bike (segment 5)
January 12, arrive in Trinidad or La Junta (segment 6), and stay overnight
January 13, leave for Los Angeles
January 14, transit through Los Angeles (segment 7)
January 14, arrive in Oakland, with my bike (segment 8)

So actually let's look at one more thing that I forgot to look at:
Overnight stays along the California Zephyr. Let's consider the stations
with stops in the middle of the day, so that I'm neither in a rush to get
to the place where I'm staying nor to get to the station in the morning.

Glenwood Springs, CO (Aspen) and Grand Junction, CO look best.
Green River, UT is okay.

There are also some stops in California the next day, but I'd rather do those
on an Amtrak California rail pass and/or with my bike.

It seems like I'd want a car or bike for Grand Junction and like the
attractions are more city-like. Oh but I'm gonna have a bike!
http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Grand_Junction

Green River is pretty small. Glenwood Springs might be pretty expensive
because it's a resort.

Hostels...
http://www.historicmelrosehouse.com/index.php
http://www.hostelcolorado.com/index.php

Both are close to the corresponding Amtrak stations.

December 31, leave Seattle
January 2, transit through Chicago and set up the storage unit (segment 1)
January 3, arrive in New York (segment 2)
January 8, leave New York
January 9, transit through Chicago, and drop off the bags (segment 3)
January 10, day trip to Yazoo City (segment 4)
January 11, transit through Chicago, pick up bike (segment 5)
January 12, stop in Grand Junction (segment 6)
January 13, leave Grand Junction
January 14, arrive in Emeryville, with my bike (segment 8)

Or, if I don't want to be as crazy,

December 31, leave Seattle
January 2, transit through Chicago and set up the storage unit (segment 1)
January 3, arrive in New York (segment 2)
January 8, leave New York
January 9, arrive in Chicago, drop off the bags, stay overnight (segment 3)
January 10, leave Chicago
January 11, stop in Grand Junction (segment 4)
January 13, leave Grand Junction
January 14, arrive in Emeryville, with my bike (segment 5)
