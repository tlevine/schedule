If I get a 14-day rail pass, what could I do? I can do up to eight segments.

Here's the simplest thing.

December 30, Seattle
January 1, Chicago (Empire Builder)
January 2, New York (Lake Shore Limited)
January 9, Chicago (Lake Shore Limited)
January 11, Emeryville (California Zeyphr)

I could go back through Portland, to see the other leg of the Empire Builder.

December 30, Seattle
January 1, Chicago (Empire Builder)
January 2, New York (Lake Shore Limited)
January 9, Chicago (Lake Shore Limited)
January 11, Portland (Empire Builder)
January 12, Oakland (Coast Starlight)

If I went back through Seattle, I could leave my bike here.

December 30, Seattle
January 1, Chicago (Empire Builder)
January 2, New York (Lake Shore Limited)
January 9, Chicago (Lake Shore Limited)
January 11, Seattle (Empire Builder)
January 12, Oakland (Coast Starlight)

I could take a detour to the Sunset Limited

December 30, Seattle
January 1, Chicago (Empire Builder)
January 2, New York (Lake Shore Limited)
January 8, New Orleans (Crescent)
January 11, Los Angeles (Sunset Limited)
January 12, Oakland (Coast Starlight)

or to the Vermonter.

December 30, Seattle
January 1, Chicago (Empire Builder)
January 2, New York (Lake Shore Limited)
January 7, St. Albans (Vermonter)
January 8, Springfield (Vermonter)
January 9, Chicago (Lake Shore Limited)
January 11, Emeryville (California Zeyphr)

Here's another idea.

December 30, Seattle
January 1, Chicago (Empire Builder)
January 2, New York (Lake Shore Limited)
January 7, St. Albans (Vermonter)
January 8, Springfield (Vermonter)
January 9, Chicago (Lake Shore Limited)
January 12, Seattle (Empire Builder)
January 13, Oakland (Coast Starlight), with bike

I can, of course, combine the interesting parts of the above itineraries
and break any of the segments into two and sight-see for a day.

I could also get a longer rail pass and use the remaining segments for
travel after Cyber Wizard Institute and during the weekends. Consider these
itineraries for a 30-day pass.

Here's another idea.

December 30, Seattle
January 1, Chicago (Empire Builder)
January 2, New York (Lake Shore Limited)
January 9, Chicago (Lake Shore Limited)
January 12, Seattle (Empire Builder)
January 13, Oakland (Coast Starlight), with bike
January 16, Somewhere for the weekend
January 19, Oakland
January 23, Somewhere for the weekend
January 26, Oakland
January 29, Somewhere to go next

In case I need to work during the week,

Wednesday, December 31, leave Seattle (present contract ends)
Friday, January 2, transit through Chicago
Saturday, January 3, arrive in New York
Friday, January 9, leave New York
Saturday, January 10, transit through Chicago
Monday, January 12, arrive in Seattle (to get my bike)
Tuesday, January 13, leave Seattle
Wednesday, January 14, arrive in Oakland

If I need to be available January 1, I can
add a stop somewhere and leave a day earlier
or arrive a day later. If I need to be available
January 13, I can split that trip into two and
leave a day earlier or arrive a day later.

The Amtrak person set up this itinerary. My confirmation number is 389BD9.

Current thinking:

Wednesday, December 31, leave Seattle (present contract ends)
Friday, January 2, transit through Chicago, set up the storage unit, and drop off my bike
Saturday, January 3, arrive in New York
Thursday, January 8, leave New York
Friday, January 9, transit through Chicago (arrive at 9:45 am, leave at 3:00 pm, check the bike by 1:00 pm to be safe)
Sunday, January 11, arrive in Emeryville

This leaves THREE EXTRA DAYS!!!

A similar possibility is to spend a day in Chicago (so I have time to
deal with the storage unit, take Southwest Chief to Los Angeles, and
spend a day there, and then take Coast Starlight up further. Or maybe
I take the Pacific Surfliner for a bit of the way so I can stay in a
different city for a night.



Day trips
================
Here's a fun idea: Take day trips where I sleep on the train.
Do this from Chicago or New York so I don't need to worry about my bike.

Chicago would fit in like so.

December 31, leave Seattle
January 2, transit through Chicago and set up the storage unit (segment 1)
January 3, arrive in New York (segment 2)
January 7, leave New York
January 8, transit through Chicago, and drop off the bags (segment 3)
January 9, first day trip (segment 4)
January 10, second day trip (segment 5)
January 11, third day trip (segment 6)
January 12, transit through Chicago, boarding the California Zeyphr with my bike (segment 7)
January 14, arrive in Emeryville, with my bike (segment 8)

I have four segments to use in these day trips, and I have as many as
five days to spend on these trips.

Let's consider, first, the City of New Orleans corridor.
http://www.amtrak.com/ccurl/744/819/City-of-New-Orleans-Schedule-060914.pdf

It leaves Chicago 0 at 8 pm, which gives me lots of time to mess with my
storage unit after arriving at 9:45 am from New York. And then I get off
in the morning at any of these cities. (I'd have more time in the earlier
cities.)

* Memphis, TN (13 hours)
* Greenwood, MS (10 hours)
* Yazoo City, MS (8 hours)
* Jackson, MS (6 hours)

If I want to spend all of my day trips on this one corridor I could take
another day trip in any of the proceeding cities and then get on the train
in the other direction the next day, to another of the preceding cities.

* Chicago, IL
* Homewood, IL
* Kankakee, IL

I could also stay at a hotel or hostel or something for a night, though
I'd rather do it at one of these cities so I have longer.
