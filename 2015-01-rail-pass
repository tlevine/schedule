If I get a 14-day rail pass, what could I do? I can do up to eight segments.

Here's the simplest thing.

December 30, Seattle
January 1, Chicago (Empire Builder)
January 2, New York (Lake Shore Limited)
January 9, Chicago (Lake Shore Limited)
January 11, Emeryville (California Zeyphr)

I could go back through Portland, to see the other leg of the Empire Builder.

December 30, Seattle
January 1, Chicago (Empire Builder)
January 2, New York (Lake Shore Limited)
January 9, Chicago (Lake Shore Limited)
January 11, Portland (Empire Builder)
January 12, Oakland (Coast Starlight)

If I went back through Seattle, I could leave my bike here.

December 30, Seattle
January 1, Chicago (Empire Builder)
January 2, New York (Lake Shore Limited)
January 9, Chicago (Lake Shore Limited)
January 11, Seattle (Empire Builder)
January 12, Oakland (Coast Starlight)

I could take a detour to the Sunset Limited

December 30, Seattle
January 1, Chicago (Empire Builder)
January 2, New York (Lake Shore Limited)
January 8, New Orleans (Crescent)
January 11, Los Angeles (Sunset Limited)
January 12, Oakland (Coast Starlight)

or to the Vermonter.

December 30, Seattle
January 1, Chicago (Empire Builder)
January 2, New York (Lake Shore Limited)
January 7, St. Albans (Vermonter)
January 8, Springfield (Vermonter)
January 9, Chicago (Lake Shore Limited)
January 11, Emeryville (California Zeyphr)

Here's another idea.

December 30, Seattle
January 1, Chicago (Empire Builder)
January 2, New York (Lake Shore Limited)
January 7, St. Albans (Vermonter)
January 8, Springfield (Vermonter)
January 9, Chicago (Lake Shore Limited)
January 12, Seattle (Empire Builder)
January 13, Oakland (Coast Starlight), with bike

I can, of course, combine the interesting parts of the above itineraries
and break any of the segments into two and sight-see for a day.

I could also get a longer rail pass and use the remaining segments for
travel after Cyber Wizard Institute and during the weekends. Consider these
itineraries for a 30-day pass.

Here's another idea.

December 30, Seattle
January 1, Chicago (Empire Builder)
January 2, New York (Lake Shore Limited)
January 7, St. Albans (Vermonter)
January 8, Springfield (Vermonter)
January 9, Chicago (Lake Shore Limited)
January 12, Seattle (Empire Builder)
January 13, Oakland (Coast Starlight), with bike
January 16, Somewhere for the weekend
January 19, Oakland
January 23, Somewhere for the weekend
January 26, Oakland
January 29, Somewhere to go next
