If I get a 14-day rail pass, what could I do? I can do up to eight segments.

Here's the simplest thing.

December 30, Seattle
January 1, Chicago (Empire Builder)
January 2, New York (Lake Shore Limited)
January 9, Chicago (Lake Shore Limited)
January 11, Oakland (California Zeyphr)

I could go back through Portland, to see the other leg of the Empire Builder.

December 30, Seattle
January 1, Chicago (Empire Builder)
January 2, New York (Lake Shore Limited)
January 9, Chicago (Lake Shore Limited)
January 11, Portland (Empire Builder)
January 12, Emeryville (California Zeyphr)

I could take a detour to the Sunset Limited

December 30, Seattle
January 1, Chicago (Empire Builder)
January 2, New York (Lake Shore Limited)
January 8, New Orleans (Crescent)
January 11, Los Angeles (Sunset Limited)
January 12, Oakland (Coast Starlight)

or to the Vermonter.

December 30, Seattle
January 1, Chicago (Empire Builder)
January 2, New York (Lake Shore Limited)
January 7, St. Albans (Vermonter)
January 8, Springfield (Vermonter)
January 9, Chicago (Lake Shore Limited)
January 11, Emeryville (California Zeyphr)

I can, of course, combine the interesting parts of the above itineraries
and break any of the segments into two and sight-see for a day.
