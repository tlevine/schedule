I can switch to storing one or two boxes with Ship2Storage.
https://www.ship2storage.com.

One of the two "boxes" would be my pink suitcase. For the other, I could buy
a fancy one from Grainger.

Here's what I do with the stuff in the unit.

Clothes

* Leave the clothes that are falling apart at home.
* Take three pairs of nice clothes with me.
* Mail the remaining nice clothes that fit me to Ship2Storage.
* Give clothes to people I know.
* Donate any leftover clothes to a thrift shop.
* Most of my shoes are fine but just a bit too big.
  What do I do!? Let's hope they fit in the box and
  I don't have to think about it. I could also tie
  them to my bike and deal with them later.

Pack on the bike

* Any sort of sleeping equipment
* Desktop computer
* Power tools

Other things that get stored

* Paper notebooks
* Books
* Paper records
